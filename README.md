## What is the Language Yama ?

It is a object oriented programming Language, which is direct translate in Assembly.

### Why this new Language, Why dont use C#, Java or C?

I want to programming a Microcontroller so C# and Java can not use for this.
Yes i can use C, but it is not a OOP Language and i am not happy with this.
I want to programming with objects, inheritance ... etc.
My first reason with this project was to learn how to lexer Text and Build a ParseTree, but now it is little more.

Its come from Warhammer 40000.
It was a memory from Vargard Obyron and is it a memory from Zanndrekh.
